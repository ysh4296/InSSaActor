## Finding How is the most social butterfly Actor in Korea? 


Today we will fine the most social butterfly Actor in Korea. social butterfly means ‘인싸’ in Korea. Having many friends and popular.
I’ll call social butterfly to ‘인싸’.

### 1. Who is the most ‘인싸’ Actor?
- I think the actor who has the most friends among actors can be called a ‘인싸’. Therefore, ‘인싸’ should rank first in the number of friends.
- I'll define actors who have appeared in the same movie as friends.
But we first have to make network of Actors to find Actor-Actor relationships.then how can we solve this problem?


### 2. How to make network?

- I think the best way to make a network in this situation is using Actor - Movie relationship.
Because we define the relationship ‘friend’ related with Movie.

- So I made graph like this

- And we find Actor A and B as Friend in graph like below

- then we can find Actors friend by finding which movie he participated.


### 3. How to get Data?

- I used the Open API from “영화진흥위원회”

- First I used the list of movies to get movieCD number.
